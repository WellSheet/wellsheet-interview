# README


This is the WellsheetInterview. Our goal is to design and build a basic module to display vital information. An initial design has been added to the repo in a file called Vitals Basic Mock. We have faked an example json respone from an EHR client in using the file config/vitals.json. Bootstrap and jquery have been imported to the application. Our goal is to design and build a vitals panel using the information from the vitals.json file. The json data has already been imported to ruby model via Vital Panel model.

To setup the application, simply run rails s. A single endpoint has been added to the application, localhost:3000/vital. When you visit that endpoint you should see 'First Vital Abberviation: BP'. 

Goals
- The module should be responsive and look fine at all sizes.
- The mocks are simply a starting point. We encourage you to thing about what other information a doctor might want to see
- How can we show more details? Tool tips? Graphs?

Please do not spend more then a few hours. When you're finished, zip up the repo and email to you're contact at WellSheet.

Good Luck!
